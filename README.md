**Figment has embarked on a mission to introduce more developers to Web 3 by simplifying the experience for its users and shining the light on Web 3‚Äôs potential.**

Learn is the education and onboarding platform for developers interested in Web 3 development. With Learn, developers gain access to the most comprehensive developer portal which standardizes documentation across networks and offers in-depth practical tutorials to help you get to the next level.

Tutorials can be completed seamlessly with [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up) which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. To foster its community, Figment is partnering with foundations to reward developers for building on Web 3 protocols and sharing their knowledge with others.
