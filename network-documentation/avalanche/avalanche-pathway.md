# üó∫ Avalanche Pathway

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/avalanche_token_round-300x300.png) Welcome to the **Avalanche** Pathway

[Avalanche](https://avax.network) is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first smart contracts platform that processes 4,500+ transactions/second and instantly confirms transactions. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.

A key difference between Avalanche and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable. The Avalanche protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput, without compromising decentralization. Learn what makes it unique and build your first project to **earn $20 in AVAX**!
