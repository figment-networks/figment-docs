  transactions using the DataHub transaction search API.

# 6. Search for transactions

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in the previous tutorials, so make sure to have completed :

1. \*\*\*\*[**Connect to Polkadot using a Datahub node**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/1.-connecting-to-a-polkadot-node-with-datahub)\*\*\*\*
2. \*\*\*\*[**Create a Polkadot account**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/2.-create-a-polkadot-account)\*\*\*\*
3. \*\*\*\*[**Query the blockchain**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/3.-query-the-blockchain) _\*\*_
4. \*\*\*\*[**Submit a transaction**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/4.-submit-a-transaction)\*\*\*\*
5. \*\*\*\*[**Staking tokens**](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/polkadot/tutorials/intro-pathway-polkadot-basics/5.-staking-tokens)\*\*\*\*

In this tutorial we will be making use of a new package called axios that was installed during the setup portion in the very first tutorial. Axios will enable us to easily perform direct HTTP queries to the DataHub transaction search endpoints. In previous tutorials we used the Polkadot JS API, `@polkadot/api` and related functionality.

We would be wise to add a new variable in `.env` to store the URL of the Datahub search endpoint, because it is different from the one we have been using throughout the pathway so far :

```javascript
TX_SEARCH_URL=https://polkadot-westend--search.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<API_KEY>
```

Remember to replace `<API_KEY>` with a valid DataHub API key from the [DataHub dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io).  
Now we can create a new file called `tx_search.js` and paste the following code :

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const axios = require('axios');

const main = async () => {
  const api = axios.create({
    baseURL: process.env.TX_SEARCH_URL,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  // 1. Get the last 5 transactions on Polkadot mainet
  // 2. Get 5 last transactions for an address
  // 3. Get all staking transactions for an address
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => process.exit());
```

The `headers` object must be passed to `axios.create()` with a valid content-type. Without this, the search endpoint will not process the request properly. The `baseURL` property is specifying our endpoint from the `.env` file and because it includes our API key, there is no need to pass an `Authentication` header. `axios.create()` is used to create our request, so that when we reference `api` it gives us a direct pipeline to the search endpoint every time.

## Get the last 5 transactions on Polkadot mainnet

Place the following code below the line `// 1. Get last 5 transactions on Polkadot mainnet` :

```javascript
try {
  const result = await api.post('/transactions_search', {
    network: 'polkadot',
    chain_id: 'mainnet',
    limit: 5,
  });

  console.log('5 last transactions: ', result.data);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Error getting 5 last transactions', e.message);
}
```

Here, we are using `POST` to request 5 recent transactions from the `/transaction_search` endpoint. The specified `network` is Polkadot and the `chain_id` is Mainnet. Uppercase strings are not necessary for the request. Notice how we set the `limit` to 5. Altering this number would return a different number of results. Be careful not to set this too high or you will flood your terminal with too much output. Consider logging to a file if more output is required.

## Get the 5 last transactions for my address

Place the following code below the line `// 2. Get last 5 transactions for an address` :

```javascript
try {
  const result = await api.post('/transactions_search', {
    network: 'polkadot',
    chain_id: 'mainnet',
    limit: 5,
    account: [process.env.ADDRESS],
  });

  console.log('5 last transaction for my account: ', result.data);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Error getting 5 last transactions for account', e.message);
}
```

Here, we are using `POST` to request 5 recent transactions and specifying an account from our `.env` file. The only difference from the previous request is the `account` property, for which we specify an address using the one stored in `.env` . This value could be dynamic or hardcoded depending on what is required.

## Get all staking transactions for my address

Place the following code below the line `// 3. Get all staking transactions for my address` :

```javascript
try {
  const result = await api.post('/transactions_search', {
    network: 'polkadot',
    chain_id: 'mainnet',
    account: [process.env.ADDRESS],
    types: ['nominate', 'bonded', 'reward'],
  });

  console.log('Staking transactions: ', result.data);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Error getting staking transactions for my account', e.message);
}
```

In this final example, we are adding an array of `types` which includes the identifiers for the types of transactions we want to know about. We have also removed the `limit` property so that all of the types we have requested data on will be returned.

With all the code in place, we can now run our search program using the following command :

```javascript
$ node tx_search.js
```

The following sample output has been trimmed for display purposes \(indicated by `...`\) :

```javascript
5 last transactions:  [
  {
    id: '39a53bd6-f6b1-4d4c-88d0-37fe49cb65e1',
    hash: '0x068d0c7597e5d92a38605f5a3d89fc070eaac1bfff5ff8446a890000be72709a',
    block_hash: '0xed013be913edff468e4827e57030262e97578a09ddda8665fd9ef11af1d6af0f',
    height: 5283128,
    epoch: '3580',
    chain_id: 'westend',
    time: '2021-04-19T19:02:36Z',
    version: '0.0.1',
    events: [ [Object] ],
    has_errors: false
  },
  ...
  5 last transaction for my account:  [
  {
    id: 'f4301e60-8b59-41c9-9d29-d3b8a56c0eec',
    hash: '0x54850cc8abfa6f6e9aee819173ddd05370d6afce7f8a2cb0d6d5e091c92baa7f',
    block_hash: '0x61320f2944d88abc3651176c78a1d8612d72addc61d3b66442cedcaf46e840ff',
    height: 5238705,
    epoch: '3568',
    chain_id: 'westend',
    time: '2021-04-16T17:00:18Z',
    transaction_fee: [ [Object] ],
    version: '0.0.1',
    events: [ [Object] ],
    has_errors: false
  },
  ...
  Staking transactions:  [
  {
    id: 'f4301e60-8b59-41c9-9d29-d3b8a56c0eec',
    hash: '0x54850cc8abfa6f6e9aee819173ddd05370d6afce7f8a2cb0d6d5e091c92baa7f',
    block_hash: '0x61320f2944d88abc3651176c78a1d8612d72addc61d3b66442cedcaf46e840ff',
    height: 5238705,
    epoch: '3568',
    chain_id: 'westend',
    time: '2021-04-16T17:00:18Z',
    transaction_fee: [ [Object] ],
    version: '0.0.1',
    events: [ [Object] ],
    has_errors: false
  },
...
```

As a bonus activity, we might attempt to see what is contained within the `[Object]` being returned for the `transaction_fee` or `events` properties in a Human-readable format. Here is a hint: `result.data[0]` is a good starting point.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! We have now completed the Polkadot Pathway! All the way from installing Node.js to successfully displaying details about historical transactions on Polkadot, we have learned about advanced APIs and how to interact with accounts and even stake tokens on validators using easy to understand code.

There are many things that are beyond the scope of this Pathway, but the links provided to expand on some of the concepts contained in the pathway should at least provide ample starting points for further study. Consider refining and playing with the code from the Pathway, to see what can be built out of these foundational blocks of Polkadot.

## Next steps

There will be a Polkadot Cookbook section added to the Forums after release, which will contain the best examples of how members of the community have implemented the knowledge gained by completing this Pathway.
