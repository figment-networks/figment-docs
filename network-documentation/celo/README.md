## Welcome to the Celo documentation!

In this section, you will be able to learn about what makes Celo special and how you can leverage available tools to build amazing products!

You can then get started with the available RPC & REST APIs we support [**via DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign\_up?service=celo).

Last but not least, if you are looking for guidelines or simply some inspiration, check out available tutorials on [**Learn**](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/celo)****

Be sure to check out the [**official Celo documentation**](https://docs.celo.org/) and if you need tokens to build on testnet, you can check out the [**link here**](https://celo.org/developers/faucet).
