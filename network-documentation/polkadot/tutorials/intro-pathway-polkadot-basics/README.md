# Intro Pathway: Polkadot Basics

## ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/4129.png) Welcome to the Polkadot Pathway

Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment. It is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles, and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

Learn what makes it unique and build your first project to **earn 1.1 DOTs**!

Throughout this Pathway, we will be using Node.js to execute easily understood programs to accomplish specific tasks. From starting a code project in a new directory and installing additional software modules, to using Proxy Accounts for staking on a Validator to earn rewards, to searching for specific transactions on Polkadot using a DataHub API endpoint using JSON-RPC.

## üèÅ Get started by signing up for DataHub <a id="get-started-by-signing-up-for-datahub"></a>

Start by [setting up an account on DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=polkadot).

DataHub is Figment's infrastructure platform. It lets developers use the most powerful and unique features of a blockchain without having to become protocol experts. Throughout these tutorials we'll be using DataHub to seamlessly connect to Polkadot. [Learn more about DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/guides/datahub-products).
