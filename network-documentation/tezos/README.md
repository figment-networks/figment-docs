# âš– Tezos

## Welcome to the Tezos documentation!

In this section, you will be able to learn about what makes Tezos special and how you can leverage available tools to build amazing products!

Check out the Tezos 101 section to learn more about the protocol and see how it compares to other networks in terms of speed, cost, and functionalities.

You can then get started with the available RPC & REST APIs we support [**via DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=tezos).

Last but not least, if you are looking for guidelines or simply some inspiration, check out our list of available tutorials!

Be sure to check out the [**official Tezos documentation**](https://tezos.gitlab.io/) and its [**developer portal**](https://developers.tezos.com/)**,** and if you need tokens to build on testnet, you can check out the [**link here**](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/).
