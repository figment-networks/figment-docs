# ‚úè Provenance 101

## **What is Provenance?** <a id="what-is-cosmos"></a>

Provenance is a public blockchain network designed and developed to support [financial service industry](https://docs.provenance.io/ecosystem/financial-services-blockchain) needs by providing a **ledger**, **registry**, and **exchange** across multiple financial assets and markets.   
The Provenance blockchain is based on the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint blockchain application platforms.

### **What can you build on Provenance?**  <a id="what-can-you-build-on-cosmos"></a>

**Financial Services Use Cases** - Provenance facilitates the establishment of an ecosystem that garners participation amongst financial functions including asset originators, fund managers, servicers, banks, and investors. 

While Provenance facilitates the establishment of an ecosystem that has garnered participation across all areas of finance including, but not limited to, asset originators, fund managers, servicers, and banks, Provenance is openly extensible for developers to build innovative applications that address new use cases.

Provenance is composed of three core concepts:

* **Modules** that implement financial services business logic. Modules are composed to realize complex financial services processes.
* A **smart contracting engine** to develop and deploy contracts directly to the Provenance blockchain.
* **Off-chain client-side agreements** using the Contract Execution Environment.

Each of these core concepts has its own set of strengths allowing complete control of the consumer's private and confidential data.

## **Network Specifications** <a id="network-specifications"></a>

### **Gas & Fees** <a id="transaction-fees"></a>

Gas is purchased with Hash, the Provenance utility token.   
****Note: gas prices are normally denoted in nHash \( 1Hash = 1,000,000,000 nHash\).  
Check [Operation Gas Estimates](https://docs.provenance.io/ecosystem/financial-services-blockchain/distribution#operation-gas-estimates) on Provenance.

Fees are the total amount of Hash collected for consumed gas during the processing and minting of a block on Provenance. **Community** and **Block Proposer** fees are set by governance proposals allowing Hash holders to vote to adjust these fee percentages as necessary. Delegators can choose validators that have a lower commission to optimize the amount of fees collected from the network. 

### **Role of the HASH token** <a id="role-of-the-atom-token"></a>

**Hash** is the Provenance utility token to stake, govern, secure, and transact on the network.

Large financial institutions, investors, technical leaders, and individuals provide the foundation of security and stability of the Provenance network by staking Hash as a network validator or delegator for which they are rewarded with a fee.
