# 3. Query the Celo network

## Introduction

Now we have our account created, but wouldn’t it be nice to keep track of cUSD and CELO balances in our NodeJS app? In this tutorial, we will examine how we can do just that, plus some additional queries to get information about nodes and blocks.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you completed the tutorials:

1. [Connecting to Celo node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/tutorial/1.connect)
2. [Creating your first Celo account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/tutorial/2.account)

We will be building on top of the NodeJS application you created in the previous tutorials.

## Query account information

Let’s get to it. In order to query account information we need to use the `getTotalBalance` method, which is exposed by ContractKit.

Create `query.js` file and in it paste the snippet below:

```javascript
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const Web3 = require('web3');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Celo Network node
  const web3 = new Web3(process.env.REST_URL);
  const client = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);

  // Initialize account from our private key
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

  // 1. Query account balances
  const accountBalances = await client.getTotalBalance(account.address)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch account: ${err}`); });

  console.log('CELO balance: ', accountBalances.CELO.toString(10));
  console.log('cUSD balance: ', accountBalances.cUSD.toString(10));
  console.log('Locked CELO balance: ', accountBalances.lockedCELO.toString(10));
  console.log('Pending balance: ', accountBalances.pending.toString(10));

  // 2. Query node info

  // 3.1 Query latest block

  // 3.2 Block by number, defaults to latest, lets get block 3263105

  // 4. eth_getTransactionCount

  // 5.eth_estimateGas
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Now let’s break it down a little bit. Once we create a new client using `newKit` we need to initialize our account. Luckily, our `.env` file holds all the information we need to do just that. This line:

```javascript
const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
```

uses our private key from `.env` file and initializes the account from it.

Now that the account object is at our disposal, let’s run our first query:

```javascript
const accountBalances = await client.getTotalBalance(account.address)
```

This query uses the `address` property from the account object. There is one more interesting thing to note. This time we do not use `web3.eth` to call `client.getTotalBalance` but instead, we call it directly from the `client` object. What is going on here? ContractKit is a wrapper for web3 client, which exposes some additional Celo specific methods. `client.getTotalBalance` is one of those methods.

Ok, so now let’s see what is the output of this method. Run the script using:

```bash
node query.js
```

As you can see we print 4 things:

* **CELO balance** - amount of CELO tokens in your account
* **cUSD balance** - amount of cUSD tokens in your account
* **Locked CELO balance** - amount of locked CELO. You lock CELO when you want to vote on governance proposals or for validator elections. You can read more about voting for validator groups [here](https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/voting-validators) or voting on governance [here](https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/voting-governance)
* **Pending balance** - amount of CELO that is pending. When you vote for validator groups after you cast your vote you have to wait until the next epoch to activate your vote. If you don’t do that, your vote will be in the pending bucket.

Now you can keep track of your Celo balances from your own application. Awesome!

## Querying node information

It's always a good idea to know what node version you are working with. Let’s examine how we can do that using ContractKit and a DataHub Celo node.

Let’s add the snippet below right after our last piece of code \(1. Query account balances\):

```javascript
// 2. Query node info
const nodeInfo = await web3.eth.getNodeInfo()
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch node info: ${err}`); });
console.log('Node Info: ', nodeInfo);
```

Here we use the `eth` client again to call `eth.getNodeInfo`.

We then run the script again:

```bash
node query.js
```

The response of this query should look similar to:

```bash
celo/v1.2.1-stable/linux-amd64/go1.13.15
```

It tells us that the node exposed by DataHub is running version `v1.2.1-stable` on the `linux-amd64` machine where the Golang version `1.13.15` is installed.

## Querying block information

Blocks are the foundation of every blockchain. It would be nice to get more information about them. The `eth` client from the `@celo/contractkit` npm package allows us to query details about blocks at certain a height.

Let’s add the snippet below right after our last piece of code \(2. Query node info\)

```javascript
// 3.1 Query latest block
const blocksLatest = await web3.eth.getBlock("latest")
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch latest block: ${err}`); });
console.log('Latest block: ', blocksLatest);

// 3.2 Block by number, defaults to latest, lets get block 100
const blocks = await web3.eth.getBlock(100)
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch block: ${err}`); });
console.log('Blocks: ', blocks);

// 4. Get transactions count
const transactionCount = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account.address)
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch transaction count: ${err}`); });
console.log('Transaction Count: ', transactionCount);

// 5.Estimate gas cost
const gasEstimate = await web3.eth.estimateGas({
    to: account.address,
    data: "0xc6888fa10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
}).catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not estimate gas: ${err}`) });
console.log('Gas estimate: ', gasEstimate);
```

Here we run one query `getBlock` with two different arguments \(Steps 3.1 and 3.2\). When we pass `latest` as an argument, we query for the most recent block. If we pass a number, we query for a block at that specific height. In step 4 we call `getTransactionCount` to get the number of transactions submitted so far for our account. In step 5 we call `estimateGas` which generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. We pass in optional `data` parameter which is a hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

Run the script again using:

```bash
node query.js
```

The output of this query is a block object which looks similar to:

```javascript
{ 
  epochSnarkData: null,
  extraData:
'0xd983010001846765746889676f312e31332e3132856c696e7578000000000000f8b2c0c080b84132ee028a12cc30bc65deaa8f084823575f0383470660bd8854a3ccd3da64369c1ea7af65fa57a13580614eb55839e5d7e27d1fb6ce714fd57abccff60218b3d001f58201eeb092225d66e4ef5cdc2a7d23d947b72247bc31414d187e8f944a58e6698110e094852be7000a1d46202cc6532dc7b9d38080f58203ffb0e0df4107fa00f40adf7f478583a0b8e68816c1e9747d2199e1f4b9e2f7547af62e49185b586b45d06307299c0c8f870080',

```

Here you can find information about the timestamp at which this block has been created, transactions appended to this block, and encrypted `extraData` which holds information about validators who signed the previous block.

## Conclusion

Now you should have a basic understanding of how to query some of the most important information from the Celo node hosted by DataHub. In this tutorial, we learned how to get more information about your account’s balances, node information, and block information.

The complete code for this tutorial can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/figment-networks/tutorials/tree/main/celo/3_query_node).

### Next steps

Querying for useful information is fun, but being able to submit transactions and change the state of a blockchain is even better. In our next tutorial, we will dive deeper and submit our first transactions on Celo.
