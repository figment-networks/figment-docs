# Sample Tutorial Structure

## Introduction

Explain why this tutorial matter and what the context is, what we're going to build and learn in this tutorial.

* Explain this section like you're explaining it to 5 -year old
* Explain everything in 5-6 lines max

_For example -_

NEAR is a platform that allows anyone to create decentralized applications that can perform tasks without the need for a central entity. Building a Voting dApp is a good candidate for something that can showcase NEAR's power and potential_._ We're going to build a smart contract using solidity, front end with ReactJS and at the end, we will deploy our dApp on NEAR testnet.

## **Prerequisites**

Any prior knowledge needed or existing tutorials that need to be completed first, any tokens needed, mention them here.

_For example -_

* In this tutorial, we're going to build a Voting dApp on NEAR using DataHub so before we proceed further make sure to complete the Tutorial 1 "Connect to NEAR Node using DataHub" of the [NEAR Pathway]()
* Complete the [Simple AssemblyScript App]() Tutorial, first.

## **Requirements**

Any technology that needs to be installed **prior** to starting the tutorial and that the tutorial will not cover \(`Metamask`, `node`, `truffle`, etc\). Do not list packages that will be installed in the tutorial \(`dotenv`\).

_For example -_

* We'll need Metamask in this tutorial, install it from [HERE](https://metamask.io/)
* Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ version installed

\[ **OPTIONAL :** Embed any video content here if you have any \]

## Body of the Tutorial

Points to remember -

* Section headings like Introduction, etc. must all be H1, keep subheadings at H2. H3 can be used for sub-section headings, but be aware that H3 does not show on the GitBook table of contents
* Add all relevant Code Blocks
* Add necessary comments in Code Blocks
* Add Text Content
* Add Output Images or Code Blocks to reflect expected terminal output
* Add common errors and steps to troubleshoot the errors, _for example -_

{% hint style="info" %}
### Not able to connect to the Avalanche Node and getting error on executing `node connect.js`

Let's check for some common causes:

* First, make sure you have `.env` file saved and it's in the correct format as given in the tutorial.
* If you're getting an error message like `UnauthorizedError: { "message":"Invalid authentication credentials"` then make sure to replace the &lt;API\_KEY&gt; with your correct API key which you copied from your DataHub Dashboard. 
* Make sure to have your `.env` file saved in your project root folder.
* Make sure`NODE_URL` in .env file is correct
* If still, you're experiencing the same issue, for help reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fszyM7K) or [Forum](https://community.figemnt.io)
