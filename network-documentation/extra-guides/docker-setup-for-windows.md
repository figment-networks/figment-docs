2. Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer. If you haven’t already downloaded the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe), you can get it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). It typically downloads to your Downloads folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.
3. When prompted, ensure the Enable Hyper-V Windows Features option is selected on the Configuration page.
4. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install.

6. If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the docker-users group. Run Computer Management as an administrator and navigate to  Local Users and Groups > Groups > docker-users. Right-click to add the user to the group. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
7. Docker Desktop does not start automatically after installation. To start Docker Desktop, search for Docker, and select Docker Desktop in the search results.
