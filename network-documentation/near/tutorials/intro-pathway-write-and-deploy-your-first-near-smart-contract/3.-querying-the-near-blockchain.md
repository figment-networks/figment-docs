# 3. Query the NEAR blockchain

## Introduction

Often times you will need to pull information about the blockchain and its state such as:

* Node information
* Most recent synced block
* Validator set status
* Account balances
* Transaction details

Letâ€™s see how this can be done by using DataHub to connect to a NEAR node.

In this tutorial, we will explore different queries that we can run against our DataHub NEAR node. More specifically, we will take a look at retrieving data about:

* Blockchain details
* Account details
* Gas Prices
* Validator set

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connecting to a NEAR node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-near-node-using-datahub)
2. [Creating your first NEAR account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/2.-creating-your-first-near-account-using-the-sdk)

We will be building on top of the Nodejs application created in these tutorials.

Make sure you have access to the NEAR node available on [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=near).

{% hint style="info" %}
Archive nodes allow you to query historical data, no matter how old it is.
{% endhint %}

## Query Blockchain Details

We can start by creating a new file `query.js` in our project root directory. Use the following code:

```javascript
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();

// Load NEAR Javascript API components
const near = require("near-api-js");

// Setup default client options
const options = {
  networkId:   process.env.NEAR_NETWORK,
  nodeUrl:     process.env.NEAR_NODE_URL,
  walletUrl:   `https://wallet.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  helperUrl:   `https://helper.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  explorerUrl: `https://explorer.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  accountId:   process.env.NEAR_ACCOUNT, 
  keyStore:    {}
}

async function main() {
  // Configure the client with options and our local key store
  const client = await near.connect(options);
  const provider = client.connection.provider;

  // Make queries to the blockchain here:
  // 1) get status
  // 2) get latest block
  // 3) get block by number
  // 4) get current validators
  // 5) get account details
  // 6) get gas price
}

main()
```

This might look familiar to you. Starting from the top you can see that we import NEAR Javascript API, `dotenv`, and then create a new client instance using `near.connect`. This establishes the connection to our NEAR node.

{% hint style="info" %}
Everything looks exactly the same as in our previous tutorial \(Account Creation\) but we have omitted the account key loading part since it's not used in this tutorial.
{% endhint %}

Alright, let's move onto the querying part!

### Fetching Node Status

Let's start by getting more information about the NEAR blockchain. In the `query.js` file under the comment `// 1).get status` add the snippet below:

```javascript
const status = await provider.status();
console.log("network status:", status);
```

Run the code:

```javascript
node query.js
```

This should return a response similar to:

```javascript
{ version: { version: '1.16.0-rc.2', build: 'e3b3e835' },
  chain_id: 'testnet',
  protocol_version: 39,
  latest_protocol_version: 39,
  rpc_addr: '0.0.0.0:3030',
  validators:
   [ { account_id: 'node2', is_slashed: false },
     { account_id: 'mmm.pool.f863973.m0', is_slashed: false },
     { account_id: 'fresh_lockup.pool.f863973.m0',
       is_slashed: false },
     { account_id: 'blazenet.pool.f863973.m0', is_slashed: false },
     { account_id: 'node3', is_slashed: false }],
  sync_info:
   { latest_block_hash: '4GuNDpD94QyGpuHiqNDgwe7sYBPjmtjPtfmy4Bpbq72Z',
     latest_block_height: 23161123,
     latest_state_root: 'DdpRTcETS7KyHGNkjQbYbMRoftcQWq27fybp1MTY6Zo9',
     latest_block_time: '2020-11-06T22:06:25.331363257Z',
     syncing: false },
  validator_account_id: 'nearup-node9' }
```

There's plenty of useful information in the output, like the node's software version which you might need to check before making any other calls. You can also see the sync information, like `latest_block_time` and `latest_block_height`.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is very useful information to make sure that the NEAR Javascript API you use is compatible with the node you are connecting to.
{% endhint %}

### Fetching Blocks

Good job! Now that you have more information about the blockchain and the node, we can start checking some of the blocks available in the blockchain. Add the following snippet and run the code:

```javascript
// Get the latest block
let block = await provider.block({ finality: "final" });
console.log("current block:", block);

// Get the block by number
block = await provider.block({ blockId: status.sync_info.latest_block_height });
console.log("block by height:", block);
```

You should see an output similar to:

```javascript
{ author: 'dokia.pool.f863973.m0',
  header:
   { height: 23161121,
     epoch_id: 'FwzrHMiKgM2T93tm1ot8owXa6f2kdVuVLPgA2f6KZg6x',
     next_epoch_id: '6QRqPduoPZS2RWEPXqPPyMngscw9iXJCYTCi17BE9QWd',

     prev_state_root: 'DdpRTcETS7KyHGNkjQbYbMRoftcQWq27fybp1MTY6Zo9',

     latest_protocol_version: 39 },
  chunks:
   [] }
```

We have fetched the last available block along with a block at a specific height. There's a lot of information available in the output, such as block `height`, its `epoch`, previous block info \(hash\), timestamp. You can also determine what the gas price was by looking at `gas_price` attribute.

Each block has a block proposer `producer` field that references the validator account. All blocks must be "approved" by a consensus of validators on the network, you can find a list of a public keys for such validators in the `approvals` attribute.

{% hint style="info" %}
There's no guarantee that block exists at each height. When fetching block by height, the RPC might return an error `block does not exist` . Fetching older blocks on non-archive nodes will also result in error `block missing` since data is purged periodically on those nodes.
{% endhint %}

### Fetching Validators

Let's get the current validator set for the network. Add the following snippet to the `query.js` and run the code:

```javascript
const validators = await provider.validators(block.header.epoch_id);
console.log("network validators:", validators);
```

You should see an output similar to:

```javascript
{ current_validators:
   [ { account_id: '01node.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:3iNqnvBgxJPXCxu6hNdvJso1PEAc1miAD35KQMBCA3aL',
       is_slashed: false,
       stake: '476089896447829945349079431137',
       shards: [Array],
       num_produced_blocks: 640,
       num_expected_blocks: 640 },
     { account_id: 'alexandruast.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:A3XJ3uVGxSi9o2gnG2r8Ra3fqqodRpL4iuLTc6fNdGUj',
       is_slashed: false,
       stake: '409846683819504337756216490413',
       shards: [Array],
       num_produced_blocks: 534,
       num_expected_blocks: 535 }],
  next_validators:
   [ { account_id: '01node.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:3iNqnvBgxJPXCxu6hNdvJso1PEAc1miAD35KQMBCA3aL',
       stake: '479638296814814009977544566442',
       shards: [Array] },
     { account_id: 'alexandruast.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:A3XJ3uVGxSi9o2gnG2r8Ra3fqqodRpL4iuLTc6fNdGUj',
       stake: '412901335059972822842553582343',
       shards: [Array] }],
  current_fishermen: [],
  next_fishermen: [],
  current_proposals:
   [ { account_id: 'chorus-one.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:6LFwyEEsqhuDxorWfsKcPPs324zLWTaoqk4o6RDXN7Qc',
       stake: '191557490436644139481317255554' },
     { account_id: 'kytzu.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:61tgPZpy8tqFeAwG4vtf2ZKCRoENiP2A1TJVWEwnbxZU',
       stake: '313896932517111981968680436586' },
     { account_id: 'nodeasy.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:25Dhg8NBvQhsVTuugav3t1To1X1zKiomDmnh8yN9hHMb',
       stake: '13158563668237262053439193507' },
     { account_id: 'stakin.pool.f863973.m0',
       public_key: 'ed25519:GvddxjaxBCqGGB4kMNWNFtvozU1EEZ2jrnggKZW8LaU4',
       stake: '321081987367847518116556177802' } ],
  prev_epoch_kickout:
   [ { account_id: 'mmm.pool.f863973.m0', reason: [Object] },
     { account_id: 'moonlet.pool.f863973.m0', reason: [Object] } ],
  epoch_start_height: 23139745 }
```

A validator set is a group of network validator nodes that performs block creation and validation. In the output above you can see a list of current validators at the latest block \(`current_validators`\), validators for the next epoch \(`next_validators`\).

The most important metric for a validator is its efficiency and we can easily determine that value by looking at `num_produced_blocks` and `num_expected_blocks`. Ideally, the efficiency should be at 100% produced vs expected blocks, but depending on the networking conditions and other factors this value could go down by as much as 10% and if the validator's efficiency is lower than 90% it gets booted from the current set.

{% hint style="info" %}
The validator efficiency metric is important for deciding which validator to stake with.
{% endhint %}

### Fetching Account

Let's get our own account status. Add the following snippet and run the code:

```javascript
const account = await client.account(options.accountId);
console.log("account state:", await account.state());
```

You should see an output similar to:

```javascript
{ amount: '497999911726975000000000000',
  locked: '0',
  code_hash: '11111111111111111111111111111111',
  storage_usage: 182,
  storage_paid_at: 0,
  block_height: 23161124,
  block_hash: 'A5KNU6nhaj79xNgrufnip1HaPyPzkZmuZUYXNotN9C8R' }
```

We can see what the current balance is at the current blockchain height.

### Fetching Gas Price

Finally, we're going to fetch the current gas price. While the other examples used the built-in Javascript API methods, this one will be using a direct RPC function call since the function to fetch gas price is not part of the API.

Add the following snippet and run the code:

```javascript
const gasPrice = await provider.sendJsonRpc("gas_price", [null]);
console.log("gas price:", gasPrice);

// Get current gas price from the block header
const anotherBlock = await provider.sendJsonRpc("block", { finality: "final" });
console.log("gas price from header:", anotherBlock.header.gas_price);
```

Output is pretty short for this one:

```javascript
{ gas_price: '100000000' }
```

### Making RPC calls

In the example above we've used a direct RPC call to fetch the information we need. While the NEAR Javascript API provides the majority of functions that you might need for basic operations \(like block fetching, transaction issuing, balance checks, etc\) it is important to know your options.

To make an RPC call you run the code like:

```javascript
const client = await near.connect(options);
const provider = client.connection.provider;

result = await provider.sendJsonRpc("METHOD_NAME", [ARGS]);
```

For example, if you want to fetch a block by height the RPC call might look like this:

```javascript
provider.sendJsonRpc("block", { block_id: 12344567 })
```

See a list of all available methods in the [**NEAR documentation**](https://learn.datahub.figment.io/network-documentation/near/rpc-and-rest-api/near-rpc).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Now you know how to query a NEAR node with DataHub to get the information you need. For more queries please refer to the [NEAR RPC](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/rpc-and-rest-api/near-rpc) and [NEAR Javascript API](https://near.github.io/near-api-js/) documentation.

The complete code for this tutorial can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/figment-networks/tutorials/blob/main/near/3_query_node/main.js).

### Next Steps

Being able to query a NEAR node is fun, but wouldn't it be great if you could not only read but also write to the blockchain? In the next tutorial, we will explore the use of transactions in order to write to the blockchain state.
