# 4. Submit your first Secret transaction

## Introduction

At some point, while building on the Secret Network, you will want to submit transactions.

In this tutorial, we will learn two ways to submit transactions using SecretJS and a [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=secret) node.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connect to a Secret Network node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-secret-node-using-datahub)
2. [Create your first Secret Network account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/2.-setting-up-your-wallet)
3. [Query the Secret Network](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/3.-querying-the-secret-blockchain)

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in these tutorials.

In the previous tutorials, we created our account and we used the Testnet faucet to request test tokens. Now that we have some tokens to spend, let's send some of them to another account.

Ok, letâ€™s move on to writing our first transaction!

### Simple Transfers

Start by creating a new file `transfer.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```rust
const {
  EnigmaUtils, SigningCosmWasmClient, Secp256k1Pen, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey,
} = require('secretjs');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;
  const httpUrl = process.env.SECRET_REST_URL;
  const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get signing pen: ${err}`); });
  const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);
  const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');

  // 1. Initialise client

  // 2. Send tokens

  // 3. Query the tx result
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Unlike before, we didn't import CosmWasmClient to connect to Secret Network, instead we imported SigningCosmWasmClient, the bigger brother of CosmWasmClient with signing capability to interact with a CosmWasm blockchain. It provides convenience methods for executing contracts, sending tokens etc.

So first let's initialize that, in the transfer.js file under the comment `// 1. Initialize client` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const txEncryptionSeed = EnigmaUtils.GenerateNewSeed();
  const fees = {
    send: {
      amount: [{ amount: '80000', denom: 'uscrt' }],
      gas: '80000',
    },
  };
  const client = new SigningCosmWasmClient(
    httpUrl,
    accAddress,
    (signBytes) => signingPen.sign(signBytes),
    txEncryptionSeed, fees,
  );
```

We generated a seed and configured fee amounts before initializing the signing client.

### Send tokens

Under the comment `// 2. Send tokens` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const rcpt = accAddress; // Set recipient to sender for testing, or generate another account as you did previously.

  // optional memo
  const memo = 'sendTokens example';

  // Send 1 SCRT / 1000000 uscrt
  const sent = await client.sendTokens(rcpt, [{ amount: '1000000', denom: 'uscrt' }], memo)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not send tokens: ${err}`); });
  console.log('sent', sent);
```

### Query transaction

Under the comment `// 3. Query the tx result` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const query = { id: sent.transactionHash };
  const tx = await client.searchTx(query)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not execute the search: ${err}`); });
  console.log('Transaction: ', tx);
```

Let's run the code:

```text
node transfer.js
```

If everything works \(you have enough tokens, recipient is valid, etc\) you should see an output similar to:

```javascript
Transaction:  [
  {
    height: 504795,
    hash: '8ED3C35EA83EF2A016AF900172563E0D7ECFA2AC00C616714EF3C68FC9AE9526',
    code: 0,
    rawLog: '[{"msg_index":0,"log":"","events":[{"type":"message","attributes":[{"key":"action","value":"send"},{"key":"sender","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"module","value":"bank"}]},{"type":"transfer","attributes":[{"key":"recipient","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"amount","value":"1234uscrt"}]}]}]',
    logs: [ [Object] ],
    tx: { type: 'cosmos-sdk/StdTx', value: [Object] },
    timestamp: '2020-12-12T06:43:19Z'
  }
]
```

Copy the transaction's `hash` from the output and replace `<TRANSACTION HASH>` in the link below, to see the transaction in Secret Explorer!

`https://explorer.secrettestnet.io/transactions/<TRANSACTION HASH>`

Great success! Our transaction went through and made it into the blockchain. Let's move onto the advanced transfers part of the tutorial.

### Advanced Transfers

Now that we know how to perform a simple money transfer we can dig a bit deeper and build a transaction from scratch. Such experience might be super useful for any developers interesting in building advanced applications.

Start by creating a new file `send.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```rust
const {
  CosmWasmClient, Secp256k1Pen, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey, makeSignBytes,
} = require('secretjs');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // As in previous tutorial, initialise client from ENV
  const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;
  const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get signing pen: ${err}`); });
  const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);
  const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');
  const client = new CosmWasmClient(process.env.SECRET_REST_URL);

  // Optionally, define a memo for the transaction
  const memo = 'My first secret transaction, sending uscrt to my own address';

  // 1. Define TX message

  // 2. Define fees

  // 3. Sign transaction

  // 4. Broadcast TX

  // 5. Query TX by hash/ID
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

By now this should look familiar to you. Starting from the top you can see that we import `secretjs`, `dotenv`, and then create a new instance using `CosmWasmClient`. This establishes the connection to our Secret Network node. We then get the network and account information.

### Define TX message

In the `send.js` file under the comment `// 1. Define TX message` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const sendMsg = {
    type: 'cosmos-sdk/MsgSend',
    value: {
      from_address: accAddress,
      to_address: accAddress,
      amount: [
        {
          denom: 'uscrt',
          amount: '1000000',
        },
      ],
    },
  };
```

### Define fees

Under the comment `// 2. Define fees` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const fee = {
    amount: [
      {
        amount: '50000',
        denom: 'uscrt',
      },
    ],
    gas: '100000',
  };
```

### Sign transaction

Under the comment `// 3. Sign transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const chainId = await client.getChainId()
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get chain id: ${err}`); });
  const { accountNumber, sequence } = await client.getNonce(accAddress)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get nonce: ${err}`); });
  const signBytes = makeSignBytes([sendMsg], fee, chainId, memo, accountNumber, sequence);
  const signature = await signingPen.sign(signBytes)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not sign: ${err}`); });
  const signedTx = {
    msg: [sendMsg],
    fee,
    memo,
    signatures: [signature],
  };
```

### Broadcast transaction

Under the comment `// 4. Broadcast transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const { transactionHash } = await client.postTx(signedTx)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not post tx: ${err}`); });
```

### Query transaction

Under the comment `// 5. Query transaction` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const query = { id: transactionHash };
  const tx = await client.searchTx(query)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not search tx: ${err}`); });
  console.log('Transaction: ', tx);
```

Let's run the code:

```text
node send.js
```

If everything works \(you have enough tokens, recipient is valid, etc\) you should see an output similar to:

```javascript
Transaction:  [
  {
    height: 400136,
    hash: '7C3C689EA4CEAD0C89BE039063909307C5C9048F76DF05E387E0368BD1C4435C',
    code: 0,
    rawLog: '[{"msg_index":0,"log":"","events":[{"type":"message","attributes":[{"key":"action","value":"send"},{"key":"sender","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"module","value":"bank"}]},{"type":"transfer","attributes":[{"key":"recipient","value":"secret1cdycaskx8g9gh9zpa5g8ah04ql0lzkrsxmcnfq"},{"key":"amount","value":"1000000uscrt"}]}]}]',
    logs: [ [Object] ],
    tx: { type: 'cosmos-sdk/StdTx', value: [Object] },
    timestamp: '2020-12-05T07:42:52Z'
  }
]
```

Copy the transaction's `hash` from the output and replace `<TRANSACTION HASH>` in the link below. OPEN LINK BELOW to see the transaction in Secret Explorer!

## Conclusion

Great job! Now you not only know how to read from the Secret Network, but also how to interact with it by crafting transactions from scratch with SecretJS and DataHub.

The complete code can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/figment-networks/tutorials/blob/main/secret/4_transactions)**.**

### Next Steps

SecretJS has a lot more to offer. We just scratched the surface of what this package can do. In the next tutorial, we will explore the use of SecretJS to deploy, instantiate, and query smart contracts.
