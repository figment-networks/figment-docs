# 2. Create your first Secret account

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will be creating your Secret Network account using SecretJS and [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/login).

### **Prerequisites**

Please make sure that you completed tutorial:

1. [Connect to a Secret Network node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-secret-node-using-datahub)

We will be building on top of the Nodejs application you created in this previous tutorial.

## **Creating Account**

Time to start building! We are finally ready to jump in and create our Secret Network account on the Holodeck testnet.

Create a file `create_account.js` with the snippet below:

```javascript
const {
  CosmWasmClient, Secp256k1Pen, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey,
} = require('secretjs');

const { Bip39, Random } = require('@iov/crypto');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create random address and mnemonic
  const mnemonic = Bip39.encode(Random.getBytes(16)).toString();

  // This wraps a single keypair and allows for signing.
  const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get signing pen: ${err}`); });

  // Get the public key
  const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);

  // Get the wallet address
  const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');

  // Query the account
  const client = new CosmWasmClient(process.env.SECRET_REST_URL);
  const account = await client.getAccount(accAddress)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get account: ${err}`); });

  console.log('mnemonic: ', mnemonic);
  console.log('address: ', accAddress);
  console.log('account: ', account);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Here is a walkthrough of for the code above:

* Import SecretJS API and initialize `dotenv`which will load variables from `.env` file to become available from `process.env.*`
* Create a randomly generated mnemonic key which is essentially an account address and a list of secret words associated with this account
* Get a keypair from the mnemonic
* Get the public key
* Get the wallet address
* Output mnemonic and `accAddress`. This is important because we will need to store those values in our `.env` file

Once this file is in place, you can run the `create_account.js` script:

```javascript
node create_account.js
```

If everything works, you should see your address and mnemonic in your console. Please make sure that you always backup your mnemonic as this is very sensitive data that allows you to restore your account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Never share your mnemonic with anyone. Never commit it to a repo. **Remember! You can share your account address, but never your mnemonic.**
{% endhint %}

In order to make sure our code doesn't leak sensitive data, we can use our `.env` file where we can store both our account address and our mnemonic. Open up `.env` and add to it below the following lines:

```javascript
...
ADDRESS='<YOUR ADDRESS>'
MNEMONIC='<YOUR MNEMONIC>'
```

Great! Now both `ADDRESS` and `MNEMONIC` will be available for use in our Nodejs scripts.

## **Getting testnet tokens**

Congratulations! You’ve just created your Secret Network account. Notice in the logs that your account is still `undefined`, that's because locally we generated a wallet but it has no funds on the network, so it does not exist yet.

Now, go to the [faucet](https://faucet.secrettestnet.io/) to get some testnet tokens.

Then you can go to this URL [https://explorer.secrettestnet.io/](https://explorer.secrettestnet.io/) to check your address with the search bar. Once you enter your address, you should see something similar to:

Great work. You’ve earned it!

## **Conclusion**

You now have an account on the Secret Network Holodeck testnet and your secret information stored in the `.env` file. You also made sure that your account balance is loaded with testnet uSCRT.

## **Next steps**

In the next tutorial, we will be looking at different queries we can run against a Secret Network node to get the information such as:

* blockchain details
* account details
