# 5. Working with LIGO Smart Contracts on Tezos

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will cover a simple way of deploying Michelson smart contracts on Tezos. "Smart contract" is a term used to describe computer code which is stored on a blockchain-based platform and executed automatically when certain conditions are met.  
  
On the Tezos network, each deployed smart contract can be called with parameters and is associated with its own balance \(an amount in tez\), as well as its own contract storage. The deployed contract is able to update its own storage, and produce a list of transactions and other operations to be executed after the execution of its own code.

There are three different flavors of[ LIGO](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction/), which is a high-level language specifically for use with Tezos. There are several other high level languages that can be used to generate Michelson code. We will focus on[ ReasonLIGO](https://ide.ligolang.org/) because it is very similar in syntax to JavaScript.  
  
Michelson is a human-readable, stack-based language. It is possible to write smart contracts in Michelson & it can also be compiled directly from LIGO.  
****One of the properties of Michelson is that it has been designed to facilitate formal verification. Formal verification is a technique to mathematically prove that a program is correct and free of bugs. Further reading on the specifics of formal verification is available[ here](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/formal-verification-framework-for-michelson/).

## LIGO and Michelson

Although it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to teach the specific syntax of LIGO or Michelson, we will cover the deployment of compiled Michelson code to Tezos. There are three different flavors of [LIGO](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction/), the one we will focus on in this tutorial is [ReasonLIGO](https://ide.ligolang.org/) because it is very similar in syntax to JavaScript. This is because it is based on a popular modelling language called [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/what-and-why).

For curious readers, there are many interesting things to be learned about these languages with the resources in the [References](references.md) section.  
  
This is the same code used in the ReasonLIGO documentation as an example smart contract :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ReasonLIGO source" %}
```javascript
type storage = int;

/* variant defining pseudo multi-entrypoint actions */

type action =
  | Increment(int)
  | Decrement(int);

let add = ((a,b): (int, int)): int => a + b;
let sub = ((a,b): (int, int)): int => a - b;

/* real entrypoint that re-routes the flow based on the action provided */

let main = ((p,storage): (action, storage)) => {
  let storage =
    switch (p) {
    | Increment(n) => add((storage, n))
    | Decrement(n) => sub((storage, n))
    };
  ([]: list(operation), storage);
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Although similar in some ways to JavaScript, ReasonLIGO is based on [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and as such does not have the same language features or exact syntax. The above contract is dissected and explained quite well in the [official ligolang.org documentation](https://ligolang.org/docs/advanced/first-contract), so we will not get into detail here. The link will also explain how to compile the contract \(out of scope for this tutorial\). When compiled to [Michelson](https://tezos.gitlab.io/michelson-reference/) code, it looks like this :

```ocaml
parameter (or (int %decrement) (int %increment)) ;
storage int ;
code { UNPAIR ; IF_LEFT { SWAP ; SUB } { ADD } ; NIL operation ; PAIR }
```

`%increment` and `%decrement` clearly match the Increment and Decrement actions from the original ReasonLIGO code. These are effectively the method names we will use to _call_ the functionality of the contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
From the [tezos.gitlab.io](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtouse.html#transfers-and-receipts) documentation : 

_A Michelson contract is expressed as a pure function, mapping a pair_ `(parameter, storage)` _to a pair_ `(list_of_operations, storage)`_. However, when this pure function is applied to the blockchain state, it can be seen as an object with a single method taking one parameter_ \(`parameter`\)_, and with a single attribute_ \(`storage`\)_. The method updates the state_  
 \(the storage\)_, and submits operations as a side effect._
{% endhint %}

Michelson code is made up of sequential instructions like `UNPAIR` and `IF_LEFT` . It is not necessary to learn the specifics of Michelson code unless formally verifying contracts or performance tuning, so do not be overly concerned with this syntax for now. Reading documentation and further experimentation is a great way to learn. 

We will now compose the Michelson code into JSON format prior to deploying it \([see here for more information on how to do it](https://ide.ligolang.org/%20)\)

Create a new file called `counter.js` and paste the following code :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/tezospath/counter.js" %}
```javascript
let CONTRACT_JSON;
export default CONTRACT_JSON = [ { "prim": "parameter",
    "args":
      [ { "prim": "or",
          "args":
            [ { "prim": "int", "annots": [ "%decrement" ] },
              { "prim": "int", "annots": [ "%increment" ] } ] } ] },
  { "prim": "storage", "args": [ { "prim": "int" } ] },
  { "prim": "code",
    "args":
      [ [ { "prim": "UNPAIR" },
          { "prim": "IF_LEFT",
            "args":
              [ [ { "prim": "SWAP" }, { "prim": "SUB" } ],
                [ { "prim": "ADD" } ] ] },
          { "prim": "NIL", "args": [ { "prim": "operation" } ] },
          { "prim": "PAIR" } ] ] } ];
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Although this file has a `.js` file extension, it is not really the JavaScript we are concerned with. Here we are looking at the JSON formatted Michelson code shown earlier. This is our smart contract, ready to be sent down the wire. The formatting and indentation are largely for readability, although it may make it slightly difficult to follow. Let us break it down quickly for better understanding :

The `[ ]` square brackets denote an array, which is comprised of `{ }` objects that contain `"key": "value pairs"`. Where it may become confusing is at the end of lines, where there are alternating `]` and `}` brackets - Do not be thrown off by this. Every open bracket will have a matching bracket to close the scope of whatever is inside. This formatting is also not something that needs to be done manually. This can be automatically generated by selecting to output the Michelson in JSON format on [https://ide.ligolang.org/](https://ide.ligolang.org/) \(screenshot below for reference\).

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/tez-ide-michelson.png)

We can now easily deploy our compiled smart contract to Tezos using a few simple lines of JavaScript.

## Deploy a compiled Michelson contract to Tezos

Create a new file called `deploy.js` and paste the following code :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/tezospath/deploy.js" %}
```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { importKey } from '@taquito/signer';
import FAUCET_KEY from './account.js';
import CONTRACT_JSON from './counter.js';
dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  const Tezos = new TezosToolkit(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);

  // 1. Deploy the contract
  importKey(
    Tezos,
    FAUCET_KEY.email,
    FAUCET_KEY.password,
    FAUCET_KEY.mnemonic.join(" "),
    FAUCET_KEY.secret
  ).then(async () => {
    return Tezos.contract.originate({
      code: CONTRACT_JSON,
      storage: 0
    })
  }).then((operation) => {
    return operation.contract()
  }).then((contract) => {
    console.log(`Deployed at: ${contract.address}`);
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`);
  });
}

main();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The asynchronous code here can be slightly confusing because of the [method chaining](https://x-team.com/blog/javascript-method-chaining/) `.then()` syntax, however it is logically broken down in sequence : 

* `importKey()` has the side effect of setting the TezosToolkit instance to use the `InMemorySigner` provider.
* _then_ an __asynchronous, anonymous arrow function expression will execute the `Tezos.contract.originate()` __function_._ This deploys the Michelson contract code to the Tezos blockchain, from the `CONTRACT_JSON` in `counter.js`. The storage property is also set to `0`.
* _then_ the resulting operation \(`op`\) object is used to provide the contract abstract \(`.contract()`\) of the newly originated contract. _See below_ for an example of what this looks like.
* _then_ the contract abstract can be logged, along with specific properties such as the deployment address.
* catch any potential errors and pass them through `JSON.stringify` for formatting when logging the error to the terminal.

Notice that each instance of `.then()` is passing along its return value to the next one in the chain. The final `.then()` statement where the console logging occurs does not have a return value, thus `.catch()` will be used next to handle any errors which may occur.  

Run the code with `node deploy.js` . Be aware that it may take several moments for the deployment to complete :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Output of /tezospath/deploy.js" %}
```ocaml
Deployed at: KT1CGobBo8pUX8E676KYCpc8waBLUiUxk223
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To get more verbose output we would simply console log the `contract` object instead of the `contract.address`

## Interact with a deployed contract

Create a new file called `call.js` and paste the following code :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/tezospath/call.js" %}
```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { importKey } from '@taquito/signer';
import FAUCET_KEY from './account.js';
dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  const Tezos = new TezosToolkit(process.env.DATAHUB_URL);
  
  // 1. Import the Faucet Key
  importKey(
    Tezos,
    FAUCET_KEY.email,
    FAUCET_KEY.password,
    FAUCET_KEY.mnemonic.join(" "),
    FAUCET_KEY.secret
  ).then(async () => {
    // Replace with deployed contract address :
    return Tezos.contract.at('KT1ECSt8FzxAtHxoxi4xN1JwkKUbBe4TS9kz')
  }).then((contract) => {
    console.log(`Incrementing storage value by 7`);
    return contract.methods.increment(7).send();
  }).then((operation) => {
    console.log(`Awaiting confirmation of ${operation.hash}`);
    return operation.confirmation(3).then(() => operation.hash);
  }).then((hash) => {
    console.log(`Operation injected: https://florence.tzstats.com/${hash}`)
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`)
  });
}

main();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

We must supply the address of our newly deployed contract to `Tezos.contract.at(' ')` , replacing the existing value between the `' '` single quotes. 

Next, using `contract.methods.increment(7).send()` will pass a value of 7 to the `increment()` method of the deployed contract. The `operation` is then available and we can retrieve the hash with `operation.hash` . The return value, `operation.confirmation(3).then(() => operation.hash)` is a bit of a clever way to express waiting for 3 block confirmations before returning the hash. The `confirmation()` optionally takes interval and timeout values, however we are not using them here.

Run the code with `node call.js` . Be aware that it may take several moments to be confirmed :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Output of node call.js" %}
```bash
Incrementing storage value by 7
Awaiting confirmation of oo1dKmibBsHeFgxg6TzE2mDSxQyhXsbFtbsYtsVAQ6UvsQLTrPL
Operation injected: https://florence.tzstats.com/...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Example contract abstraction

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example contract abstraction from " %}
```ocaml
ContractAbstraction {
  address: 'KT1CGobBo8pUX8E676KYCpc8waBLUiUxk223',
  script: { code: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ], storage: { int: '0' } },
  storageProvider: <ref *1> RpcContractProvider {
    context: Context {
      _rpc: 'https://api.tez.ie/rpc/florencenet',
      _signer: [InMemorySigner],
      _proto: undefined,
      _config: [Object],
      tz: [RpcTzProvider],
      estimate: [RPCEstimateProvider],
      contract: [Circular *1],
      batch: [RPCBatchProvider],
      wallet: [Wallet],
      _rpcClient: [RpcClient],
      _forger: [RpcForger],
      _injector: [RpcInjector],
      operationFactory: [OperationFactory],
      _walletProvider: [LegacyWalletProvider],
      _parser: [MichelCodecParser],
      _packer: [RpcPacker]
    },
    estimator: RPCEstimateProvider {
      context: [Context],
      ALLOCATION_STORAGE: 257,
      ORIGINATION_STORAGE: 257
    },
    contractProviderTypeSymbol: Symbol(taquito--provider-type-symbol)
  },
  entrypoints: { entrypoints: { increment: [Object], decrement: [Object] } },
  chainId: 'NetXxkAx4woPLyu',
  methods: { increment: [Function: method], decrement: [Function: method] },
  views: {},
  schema: Schema {
    root: IntToken {
      val: [Object],
      idx: 0,
      fac: [Function: createToken],
      createToken: [Function: createToken]
    },
    [Symbol(taquito-schema-type-symbol)]: true
  },
  parameterSchema: ParameterSchema {
    root: OrToken {
      val: [Object],
      idx: 0,
      fac: [Function: createToken],
      createToken: [Function: createToken]
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Troubleshooting

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Here is a list of potential errors and how to address them**
{% endhint %}

**SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token**  
This indicates we need to check the value entered into Tezos.contract.at\(\). The value needs to be 'single quoted'. Supplying an address without quotes will log an empty error object : Error: {} when run.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have covered the basics of LIGO, which comes in three different flavours, focusing on ReasonLIGO due to its similar syntax to JavaScript. We also illustrated the ease of deploying compiled Michelson code to Tezos using the Taquito API. This forms a powerful basis for further experimentation and dapp building on the Tezos blockchain. 

## Next Steps

Congratulations! We have completed the Tezos Pathway, all the way from initial setup to being able to deploy smart contracts. We are now empowered to learn and build on Tezos, using the dedicated infrastructure of DataHub. It is time to head to the References section and explore the LIGO documentation, or perhaps dive straight into the RPC documentation. For savvy developers who are already eager to get started on their next dapp on Tezos to earn **$20 worth of TEZ**, we welcome everyone who is interested to join the Figment Learn community today!
