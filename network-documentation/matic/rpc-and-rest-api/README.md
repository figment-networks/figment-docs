# ðŸŽ® RPC & REST API

## Time to play

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon \(Matic\) developer. All the tools you're familiar with are supported on Polygon \(Matic\) out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js. Switch over to Polygon \(Matic\)'s RPC and get started! You will be able to leverage the [matic.js SDK](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) which makes it easy for developers, who may not be deeply familiar with smart contract development, to interact with the various components of Polygon \(Matic\) Network.

This library will help developers to move assets from Ethereum chain to Polygon \(Matic\) chain, and withdraw from Polygon \(Matic\) to Ethereum using fraud proofs.
