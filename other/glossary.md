## **\#**

**51% Attack**

It‚Äôs also known as Majority Attack. When a miner or group of miners controls more than 50% of the mining power of the network then that group can disrupt the network‚Äôs mining process and can manipulate the network.

## A

**Address**

An address is used to identify private key holders when transferring value.

**Airdrop**

It's the process of distributing digital assets to the public. Just like transferring some tokens to users' wallet addresses. Nowadays companies use it as a marketing strategy.

**Altcoin**

Altcoins refers to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

**Archive Node**

An archive node stores everything kept in the full node but also builds an archive of historical states. They are necessary if you want to check the state of an account at any given block height.

**Attack Surface**

The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.

**ATOM**

The ATOM token is the native staking currency of the Cosmos Hub. Validators use the ATOM tokens to stake and secure the zones within Cosmos.

**ATH**  
It stands for All-Time-High. It used to point to the highest value/price of cryptocurrencies ever reached in history.

**AVAX**

AVAX is the Avalanche network‚Äôs native asset. It has two special uses on the Avalanche network:

* Validators must stake AVAX
* Transaction fees will be paid in AVAX

## B

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto which launched the era of cryptocurrencies.

**Block**

A block is a collection of several operations. The operations are located in the payload of the block which is specific to the protocol.

Along with the payload, the block includes a header that contains protocol-agnostic data. It consists of generic information such as the block predecessor‚Äôs hash and the block‚Äôs timestamp.

**Blockchain**

A blockchain is a digital, public ledger that records online transactions. Blockchain is the core technology for [cryptocurrencies](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/c/cryptocurrency/) like [bitcoin](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/b/bitcoin/). A blockchain ensures the integrity of a cryptocurrency by encrypting, validating, and permanently recording transactions. A blockchain is similar to a bank‚Äôs ledger but open and accessible to everyone who utilizes the cryptocurrency it supports.

**Consensus Protocol**

A consensus protocol is an algorithm, or series of steps, that a set of computers follow in order to reach an agreement on some piece of information. In a payments system, for example, the computers follow a protocol to agree on who has how much money.

**Cosmos**

Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. It is powered by the Cosmos Hub, the main communication channel between the Cosmos blockchains.

**Cryptocurrency**

A digital currency that is built using blockchain technology and secured by cryptography to use as a medium of peer to peer transaction. Eg. BTC, ETH etc.

**Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\)**

A new form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on a range of assets using derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in a savings-like account

**Fork**

A situation where two blocks are generated pointing to the same block as their parent, and some portion of miners see one block first and some see the other. This may lead to two blockchains growing at the same time. Generally, it is mathematically near-certain that a fork will resolve itself within four blocks as miners on one chain will eventually get lucky and that chain will grow longer and all miners switch to it; however, forks may last longer if miners disagree on whether or not a particular block is valid.

**Virtual Machines**

A Virtual Machine defines the application-level logic of a blockchain. In technical terms, it defines a state machine. It specifies the state that is held, the state transition function, and the transactions that clients can issue in order to query/modify the state. Developers create Virtual Machines that implements some functionality and then create a blockchain that runs the Virtual Machine. Every blockchain runs \(is an instance of\) a Virtual Machine.
