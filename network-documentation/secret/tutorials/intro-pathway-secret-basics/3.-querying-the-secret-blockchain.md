# 3. Query the Secret Network

## Introduction

Often times you will need to pull information about the blockchain and its state such as:

* Most recent synced block
* Node information
* Account details

Let’s see how this can be done by using DataHub to connect to a Secret Network node.

In this tutorial, we will explore different queries that we can run against our [**DataHub** ](https://datahub.figment.io/services/secret)Secret node. More specifically, we will take a look at retrieving data about:

* Blockchain details
* Account details

## **Prerequisites**

Please make sure that you completed tutorials:

1. [Connect to a Secret Network node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-secret-node-using-datahub)
2. [Create your first Secret Network account ](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/2.-setting-up-your-wallet)

We will be building on top of the Nodejs application you created in these previous tutorials.

## **Query blockchain details**

In your root directory, create a new file `query.js` and place in it below the following code snippet:

```javascript
const {
  CosmWasmClient,
} = require('secretjs');

require('dotenv').config();

const main = async () => {
  // Create connection to DataHub Secret Network node
  const client = new CosmWasmClient(process.env.SECRET_REST_URL);

  // 1. Query node info

  // 2. Query latest blocks

  // 3. Query account
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

This might look familiar to you. Starting from the top you can see that we import `secretjs`, `dotenv`, and then create a new instance using `CosmWasmClient`. This establishes the connection to our Secret Network node.

Ok, let’s move on to writing our first query methods!

### Node info

Let's start by getting more information about the node.

In the `query.js` file under the comment `// 1. Query node info` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const nodeInfo = await client.restClient.nodeInfo()
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch node info: ${err}`); });
  console.log('Node Info: ', nodeInfo);
```

This should return a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  node_info: {
    protocol_version: { p2p: '7', block: '10', app: '0' },
    id: '64b03220d97e5dc21ec65bf7ee1d839afb6f7193',
    listen_addr: 'tcp://0.0.0.0:26656',
    network: 'holodeck-2',
    version: '0.33.8',
    channels: '4020212223303800',
    moniker: 'ChainofSecretsBootstrap',
    other: { tx_index: 'on', rpc_address: 'tcp://0.0.0.0:26657' }
  },
  application_version: {
    name: 'SecretNetwork',
    server_name: 'secretd',
    client_name: 'secretcli',
    version: '1.0.0',
    commit: '',
    build_tags: 'netgo ledger hw production',
    go: 'go version go1.14.2 linux/amd64'
  }
}
```

In the response, you can find information about the network; such as the chain-id, its version, protocol version, and application version.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is very useful information to make sure that the CLI you use is compatible with the node you are connecting to.
{% endhint %}

### Block information

Great! Now it’s time to get some more information about the node we are connecting to. Add this snippet below the `2. Query latest blocks` comment:

```javascript
  const blocksLatest = await client.restClient.blocksLatest()
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch latest block: ${err}`); });
  console.log('Latest block: ', blocksLatest);
```

You should receive a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  block_id: {
    hash: '5D6955AD1D23751FE7D04368F91EADD2FC3F30660A8B616BD805F9BE56672789',
    parts: {
      total: '1',
      hash: '969139EDAB337E9C8416F34D87EEF426FB70C90AE571FF4B546F8FD21066C00F'
    }
  },
  block: {
    header: {
      version: [Object],
      chain_id: 'holodeck-2',
      height: '399493',
      time: '2020-12-05T06:41:27.404915442Z',
      last_block_id: [Object],
      last_commit_hash: '94E9622FB8A11D1727E5685AB3A502AE900AB7CCD7427B61B1D4423C2DB562F7',
      data_hash: '',
      validators_hash: 'DE48B10B6E3C1D46DF7E85DCBE4FA66FC0B4139548ABDA5B219265CFC051A460',
      next_validators_hash: 'DE48B10B6E3C1D46DF7E85DCBE4FA66FC0B4139548ABDA5B219265CFC051A460',
      consensus_hash: '048091BC7DDC283F77BFBF91D73C44DA58C3DF8A9CBC867405D8B7F3DAADA22F',
      app_hash: '310998D5CAA71D7E3304B706F12F5763E850BF07AA8C9143C8EEF2C884D61969',
      last_results_hash: '',
      evidence_hash: '',
      proposer_address: '996F75F6CF4B7A2EF4DA22521F2C20675E824979'
    },
    data: { txs: null },
    evidence: { evidence: null },
    last_commit: {
      height: '399492',
      round: '0',
      block_id: [Object],
      signatures: [Array]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also get a block by height, here's one with an array of transactions, for example;

```javascript
const blocks = await client.restClient.blocks(398149)
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch block: ${err}`); });
console.log('Blocks: ', blocks);
```

Now that we had a chance to look at network info, it's time to get more details about our own account.

In `query.js`, add this snippet below the comment `// 3. Query account` and run the following script:

```javascript
const account = await client.getAccount(process.env.ADDRESS)
  .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not fetch account: ${err}`); });
console.log('Account: ', account);
```

This call should return an output similar to:

```javascript
account:  {
  address: 'secret195gut3zdlsuxurx9eany3d4ejg6lznlhcm0phc',
  balance: [ { denom: 'uscrt', amount: '100000000' } ],
  pubkey: {
    type: 'tendermint/PubKeySecp256k1',
    value: 'AqcQWwunOX4t8B15lnYYt0x0OL9+OffPS/+0RbSZTM5I'
  },
  accountNumber: 21,
  sequence: 0
}
```

In this response, you can see your account address and how many uSCRT you own. Hopefully, you see `100000000` uSCRT \(100 SCRT\) that you received from the testnet faucet.

If your account balance is 0, please go to tutorial \#2 under “Getting testnet tokens” to request some free tokens. You will need them in tutorial \#4.

## **Next steps**

Being able to query a Secret Network node is fun, but wouldn’t it be great if you could not only read but also write to the blockchain? In the next tutorial, we will explore the use of transactions in order to write to the blockchain state.
