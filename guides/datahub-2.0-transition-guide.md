# ðŸ›£ DataHub 2.0 Transition Guide

## Welcome to DataHub 2.0!

DataHub 2.0 has plenty of new features to offer and a whole new design! As you migrate to the new platform, here are a few things to know.

### DataHub now has Apps&#x20;

We are launching DataHub Apps so you can manage your whole project from a single dashboard. No need for independent views for each protocol activity and analytics or separate API keys. You can now add all your protocols to a single dashboard and manage them with a single API key.

**Apps offer:**&#x20;

1. All your protocols managed via the same dashboard&#x20;
2. Advanced cross-protocol analytics with logs, request activity, latency, and errors over time&#x20;
3. Team functionalities to invite collaborators and assign roles & permissions

### DataHub now has App plans&#x20;

With the launch of Apps, we had to create new plans that would separate analytics and support from the protocol plans so that you could unify your level of service across your App, no matter the plans you choose for our RPC services.

**App plans unlock: **

1. Higher levels of support&#x20;
2. Longer log history retention&#x20;
3. Higher number of protocols that can be added to your App

{% hint style="info" %}
App plans are separate from the protocol plans you are used to, which are still in place.
{% endhint %}

### No interruption during the transition&#x20;

To make your transition to the new platform seamless, we have created individual Apps for all your existing protocols with the same API keys and payment plans you were already using. This way, you will be able to seamlessly transition to the new platform!&#x20;

**To leverage the full power of DataHub 2.0, you should: **

1. Select one App to become the command center for your project
2. Upgrade the App's plan to the level of service you are looking for
3. Add all your other protocols to this App and upgrade them to the right plan for you
4. Make sure to switch your API keys for all protocol services to the new one obtained in the App
5. Delete other Apps to remove unnecessary subscriptions
