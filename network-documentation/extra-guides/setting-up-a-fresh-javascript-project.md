# Setting up a fresh JavaScript Project with dotenv

So fresh and so clean!

## Make sure Node.js is installed

_If you are installing Node.js on WSL_, you can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl).&#x20;

Official releases of Node.js can be [downloaded from the official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once the installation is complete, or if you already have Node.js installed, type the command `node -v` inside a terminal window (such as `bash`, `zsh`, `cmd.exe` or PowerShell) to check the currently installed version.

Most modern JavaScript APIs will target Node.js v12+. Using a version manager such as **** [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [**fnm**](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is strongly encouraged, as it allows developers to quickly switch between Node.js versions as needed.

## Initialize the project directory

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enter these commands into a terminal" %}
```
mkdir samplecode
cd samplecode
npm init -y
npm install --save dotenv
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

These commands accomplish the following :

* `mkdir` creates our project directory, the directory name can be changed to anything suitable - it does not need to remain `samplecode`.
* &#x20;The `cd` command changes into the newly created directory (making it the working directory).
* &#x20;Run the node package manager - `npm` , optionally with the `-y` flag to skip the prompts and generate a default `package.json` .
* &#x20;Install the **** [**dotenv**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package, which will allow us to access environmental variables in our code. \
  \
  Assuming no errors during the installation of dotenv, the project directory will now contain these files and directories in the following structure :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Directory structure" %}
```
+-- /samplecode
    |
    +-- package.json
    |
    +-- package-lock.json
    |
    +-- /node_modules
        |  
        +-- /dotenv
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Since we used the `--save` flag when installing, it will be much easier to see which dependencies are installed by looking inside the `package.json` :

```
{
  "name": "samplecode",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^9.0.2"
  }
}
```

For anybody unfamiliar with environment variables, refer to our guide on **** [**dotenv and .env**](dotenv-and-.env.md) at this point to understand the package and what it is used for.

* _**If we are choosing to use the more modern**_** ** [**ES6 `import` syntax**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-modules-es6)_,_ when developing we will need\
  to add a line to our `package.json` in order to prevent a`SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` .\
  \
  The `import` keyword was introduced in Node.js v12, a language feature to simplify the use of modules. Alternatively, we could use an `.mjs` file extension for all of our JavaScript files, however adding this line to `package.json` enables us to keep the `.js` file extension and saves a lot of  hassle with configuration :&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Type or paste this key:value pair into package.json if using ES6 import syntax" %}
```javascript
"type": "module",
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* _**If we are choosing to use the older, slightly more common**_** `require()` **_**syntax**_, then it is unnecessary to add this line to `package.json` .&#x20;

With these steps completed, we now have a project directory that is prepared to have other dependencies installed into it using `npm install` or `yarn add` .

\
This basic setup is a sufficient start to be able to write and execute further JavaScript code using Node.js, the next step being to install whichever dependencies we would like to learn about. This is a good way to experiment and become familiar with particular JavaScript libraries.
