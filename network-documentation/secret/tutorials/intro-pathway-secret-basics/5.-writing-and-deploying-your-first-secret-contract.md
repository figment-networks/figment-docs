# 5. Write & deploy your first Secret contract

## Introduction

At some point, while building on Secret Network, you will want to create Secret Contracts in order to unlock the full power of Secret Network.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple contract using Rust, compile it to WASM binary and deploy it to the Secret Network using a [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/services/secret) node.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connect to a Secret Network node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-secret-node-using-datahub)
2. [Create your first Secret Network account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/2.-setting-up-your-wallet)
3. [Query the Secret Network](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/3.-querying-the-secret-blockchain)
4. [Submit your first Secret transaction](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/secret/tutorials/4.-submit-your-first-transaction)

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in these tutorials.

## Building Secret Contracts

Before we start working on the contract code itself, we need to install the necessary tooling to support compilation of Rust codebase into WASM.

In the terminal run the following command:

```bash
# Install Rust 
# More information about installing Rust can be found here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Add rustup target wasm32 for both stable and nightly
rustup default stable
rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

rustup install nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

# If using linux, install the standard build tools:
# apt install build-essential

# Install cargo-generate, in order to create a Secret Contract project from a template

cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
```

That should do it! Now we can move on to the development part. The purpose of this tutorial is to keep things simple and straightforward, so we will be implementing a contract with only two functions that write and read data from the blockchain store.

## Create Initial Smart Contract

To create the smart contract you'll:

* generate the initial project
* compile the smart contract
* run unit tests
* optimize the wasm contract bytecode to prepare for deployment
* deploy the smart contract to your local SecretNetwork
* instantiate it with contract parameters

### Generate the smart contract project

```text
cargo generate --git https://github.com/enigmampc/secret-template --name mysimplecounter
```

The git project above is a cosmwasm smart contract template that implements a simple counter. The contract is created with a parameter for the initial count and allows subsequent incrementing.

Once you cargo generate the project from Github and moving into the new directory you will require to recreate the `.env` file.

Change directory to the project you created and view the structure and files that were created.

```text
cd mysimplecounter
```

The `generate` creates a directory with the project name and has this structure:

```text
Cargo.lock    Developing.md    LICENSE        Publishing.md    examples    schema        tests
Cargo.toml    Importing.md    NOTICE        README.md    rustfmt.toml    src
```

The contract implementation is in `src/contract.rs`, while `src/msg.rs` contains the messages that are supported by `InitMsg` for initializing the contract, `QueryMsg` reading contract state, and `HandleMsg` for updating contract state.

```text
pub struct InitMsg {
    pub count: i32,
}

pub enum HandleMsg {
    Increment {},
    Reset { count: i32 },
}

pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetCount {},
}
```

### Compile

Use the following command to compile the smart contract which produces the wasm contract file.

```text
cargo wasm
```

### Deploy Smart Contract

Before deploying or storing the contract on the testnet, you need to run the [secret contract optimizer](https://hub.docker.com/r/enigmampc/secret-contract-optimizer).

#### Optimize compiled wasm

```text
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/contract \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  enigmampc/secret-contract-optimizer
```

This will output an optimized build file, `contract.wasm.gz`, ready to be stored on the Secret Network.

While `secretcli` supports uploading the compressed file, we'll be using SecretJS which expects wasm, so lets unpack the optimized `contract.wasm`

```bash
gunzip contract.wasm.gz
```

You should be able to find a newly created file `contract.wasm` in the current directory.

Great job! We have successfully compiled our first smart contract into a WebAssembly binary and are ready to deploy it to the Secret Network using DataHub.

## Deploying the Contract

Contract deployment on the network typically means that a compiled contract code, a WASM binary, gets broadcasted to the network as part of a transaction with a special action. We have previously covered the creation of a simple transaction, like transaction send, so creating a contract deployment is not much different.

Start by creating a new file `deploy.js` in the project directory and add the code below:

```javascript
const {
  EnigmaUtils, Secp256k1Pen, SigningCosmWasmClient, pubkeyToAddress, encodeSecp256k1Pubkey,
} = require('secretjs');

const fs = require('fs');

// Load environment variables
require('dotenv').config();

const customFees = {
  upload: {
    amount: [{ amount: '2000000', denom: 'uscrt' }],
    gas: '2000000',
  },
  init: {
    amount: [{ amount: '500000', denom: 'uscrt' }],
    gas: '500000',
  },
  exec: {
    amount: [{ amount: '500000', denom: 'uscrt' }],
    gas: '500000',
  },
  send: {
    amount: [{ amount: '80000', denom: 'uscrt' }],
    gas: '80000',
  },
};

const main = async () => {
  const httpUrl = process.env.SECRET_REST_URL;

  // Use key created in tutorial #2
  const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;

  // A pen is the most basic tool you can think of for signing.
  // This wraps a single keypair and allows for signing.
  const signingPen = await Secp256k1Pen.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not get signing pen: ${err}`); });

  // Get the public key
  const pubkey = encodeSecp256k1Pubkey(signingPen.pubkey);

  // get the wallet address
  const accAddress = pubkeyToAddress(pubkey, 'secret');

  // 1. Initialize client

  // 2. Upload the contract wasm

  // 3. Create an instance of the Counter contract

  // 4. Query the counter

  // 5. Increment the counter

  // Query again to confirm it worked
  console.log('Querying contract for updated count');
  response = await client.queryContractSmart(contractAddress, { get_count: {} })
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not query contract: ${err}`); });

  console.log(`New Count=${response.count}`);
};

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Again we start by importing `secretjs`, `dotenv`, configure fees and load up our wallet from ENV.

### Initialize client

In the `deploy.js` file under the comment `// 1. Initialize client` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const txEncryptionSeed = EnigmaUtils.GenerateNewSeed();

  const client = new SigningCosmWasmClient(
    httpUrl,
    accAddress,
    (signBytes) => signingPen.sign(signBytes),
    txEncryptionSeed, customFees,
  );
  console.log(`Wallet address=${accAddress}`);
```

### Upload the contract wasm

Under the comment `// 2. Upload the contract wasm` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const wasm = fs.readFileSync('contract.wasm');
  console.log('Uploading contract');
  const uploadReceipt = await client.upload(wasm, {})
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not upload contract: ${err}`); });
```

### Create an instance of the Counter contract

Under the comment `// 3. Create an instance of the Counter contract` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  // Get the code ID from the receipt
  const { codeId } = uploadReceipt;

  // Create an instance of the Counter contract, providing a starting count
  const initMsg = { count: 101 };
  const contract = await client.instantiate(codeId, initMsg, `My Counter${Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10000)}`)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not instantiate contract: ${err}`); });
  const { contractAddress } = contract;
  console.log('contract: ', contract);
```

First we got the `codeId` from the upload receipt, we then defined the `initMsg` with a starting count, and finally instantiated the contract.

### Query the current count

Under the comment `// 4. Query the current count` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  console.log('Querying contract for current count');
  let response = await client.queryContractSmart(contractAddress, { get_count: {} })
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not query contract: ${err}`); });

  console.log(`Count=${response.count}`);
```

### Increment the counter

Under the comment `// 5. Increment the counter` add the following code snippet below:

```javascript
  const handleMsg = { increment: {} };
  console.log('Updating count');
  response = await client.execute(contractAddress, handleMsg)
    .catch((err) => { throw new Error(`Could not execute contract: ${err}`); });
  console.log('response: ', response);
```

We defined the `handleMsg` to increment the counter, then executed the contract. Finally, we queried the updated state.

Let's run the code:

```text
node deploy.js
```

If it went well, you should see something like this;

```bash
Uploading contract
contract:  {
  contractAddress: 'secret1dsv9t7s6nn73xy3n3gfa7akham4td447vwfd5m',
  logs: [ { msg_index: 0, log: '', events: [Array] } ],
  transactionHash: 'E201BBC45316985C6FAED52BA02102734AA597EA9A54E5B4DD99B65D74AACBF2',
  data: '6C1855FA1A9CFD1312338A13DF76D7EEEAB6D6BE'
}
Querying contract for current count
Count=101
Updating count
response:  {
  logs: [ { msg_index: 0, log: '', events: [Array] } ],
  transactionHash: '6620088CA59078843A367B96E6C468CB5E2100CE497D45F786BBBC5C4EE74BD0',
  data: Uint8Array(0) []
}
Querying contract for updated count
New Count=102
```

Copy `transactionHash` from the output of either the contract upload transaction, or the contract execution to update the counter, and replace `<TRANSACTION HASH>` in the link below to see the transaction in Secret Explorer! `https://explorer.secrettestnet.io/transactions/<TRANSACTION HASH>`
