# 2. Create your first NEAR account

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will be creating your first Near account using the NEAR JavaScript API and [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=near).

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

1. [Connecting to a NEAR node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/tutorials/1.-connecting-to-a-near-node-using-datahub)
2. Make sure you have Git installed. 

We will be building on top of the Node.js application created in these tutorials.

## Creating an Account

We are finally ready to jump in and create our first NEAR account. There are currently a few ways to create a new account on NEAR Testnet:

* Programmatically with NEAR Javascript API _\(this tutorial\)_
* In browser by using the [NEAR Wallet](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/near-wallet)
* In terminal by using the [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli#near-create-account)

We will be creating an account programmatically using the javascript client package, however you might find it useful to explore other options, they're listed at the end of this tutorial.

### Get Started

Time to start building! Make a new file `create_account.js` with the snippet below:

```javascript
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();

// Load Near Javascript API components
const near = require("near-api-js");
const fs = require("fs");

// Configure the directory where NEAR credentials are going to be stored
const credentialsPath = "./credentials";

// Configure the keyStore to be used with the NEAR Javascript API
const UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore = near.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore;
const keyStore = new UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(credentialsPath);

// Setup default client options
const options = {
  networkId:   process.env.NEAR_NETWORK,
  nodeUrl:     process.env.NEAR_NODE_URL,
  walletUrl:   `https://wallet.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  helperUrl:   `https://helper.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  explorerUrl: `https://explorer.${process.env.NEAR_NETWORK}.near.org`,
  accountId:   process.env.NEAR_ACCOUNT, 
  keyStore:    keyStore
}

async function main() {
  let keyPair;

  // Configure the client with options and our local key store
  const client = await near.connect(options);

  // Configure the key pair file location
  const keyRootPath = client.connection.signer.keyStore.keyDir;
  const keyFilePath = `${keyRootPath}/${options.networkId}/${options.accountId}.json`;

  // Check if the key pair exists, and create a new one if it does not
  if (!fs.existsSync(keyFilePath)) {
    console.log("Generating a new key pair")
    keyPair = near.KeyPair.fromRandom("ed25519");
  } else {
    let content = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(keyFilePath).toString());
    keyPair = near.KeyPair.fromString(content.private_key);

    console.log(`Key pair for account ${options.accountId} already exists, skipping creation`);
  }

  // Create a key pair in credentials directory
  await client.connection.signer.keyStore.setKey(options.networkId, options.accountId, keyPair);

  // Determine if account already exists
  try {
    await client.account(options.accountId);
    return console.log(`Sorry, account '${options.accountId}' already exists.`);
  }
  catch (e) {
    if (!e.message.includes("does not exist while viewing")) {
      throw e;
    }
  }

  // Generate a public key for account creation step
  const publicKey = keyPair.getPublicKey()

  // Create the account
  try {
    const response = await client.createAccount(options.accountId, publicKey);
    console.log(`Account ${response.accountId} for network "${options.networkId}" was created.`);
    console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------");
    console.log("OPEN LINK BELOW to see account in NEAR Explorer!");
    console.log(`${options.explorerUrl}/accounts/${response.accountId}`);
    console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------");
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.log("ERROR:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

Looks like a lot of code! No worries, the most important bits are explained in the walkthrough below.

### Environment variables

First, we load the node environment variables from the `.env` file. This part is unchanged from the previous tutorial and will be used in the following tutorials. We're not adding any new variables at this time.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
```

### Key store configuration

In order to create a new account, we will first need to generate a Key Pair, a set of a private and public keys that will be associated with our account and used to perform operations on the network.

```javascript
const credentialsPath = "./credentials";
const UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore = near.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore;
const keyStore = new UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(credentialsPath);
```

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will store the generated keys in the plain text format under `credentials/testnet` directory. No need to create it though, the SDK will take care of that. The NEAR JavaScript API supports multiple store configurations.

The `testnet` portion of the path comes from the `NEAR_NETWORK` environment variable and is used to separate credentials for different networks.

### Key pair generation

To generate the private / public key pair we run the following bit:

```javascript
const keyPair = near.KeyPair.fromRandom("ed25519");

keyPair.toString()
// prints 'ed25519:CXaaFwYhMtPrefW5xp2Rs9vVHGAjPKponfihvaDq5SFbdWTRWUHCVmk3o9pBozwCs3yN87s....'
key.publicKey.toString()
// prints 'ed25519:BLEQ1a4VEmFjAEMdQ46g1A5UBrfadMPjeYPNjjU2oNGQ'
```

The keys are then stored in `./credentials/testnet/ACCOUNTID.json` by running:

```javascript
client.connection.signer.keyStore.setKey(options.networkId, options.accountId, keyPair);
```

Here's what the file might look like:

```javascript
{
  "account_id": "ACCOUNTID",
  "public_key": "ed25519:XEfrpVXEbFmg8T6UZkCv8JBfjJyGMUgsfdh7mcuShwxf",
  "private_key": "ed25519:3t9XGk9cC2at66FSjuVGMBE9PQJhyfJSfw3MRxrMSi8zRqn9oKon9H..."
}
```

You can also use the generated keys file with the NEAR [CLI](https://github.com/near/near-cli) tool for any operations in the future.

By default NEAR CLI expects all credentials to live in `~/.near-credentials` directory so you can copy the keys by running the following commands \(on Linux/Mac\):

```text
mkdir -p ~/.near-credentials/default
cp credentials/testnet/*.json ~/.near-credentials/default/
```

### Account creation

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't forget to set a unique`NEAR_ACCOUNT` name in your .env file! For demo purposes below, we set it to:`"figment-learn.testnet"`
{% endhint %}

The last step in the account creation process is the RPC call to the node to issue a new account. It's done by calling `createAccount` with our account name and a public key created in the section above.

```javascript
client.createAccount(options.accountId, keyPair.getPublicKey());
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important that you set the `helperUrl` in the options variable. The NEAR helper is a service that manages accounts on the network and also acts as a faucet on the Testnet.
{% endhint %}

Also, see [**documentation**](https://docs.near.org/docs/roles/integrator/implicit-accounts#generating-a-key-pair-first) on how the accounts are created using NEAR CLI in case if you hit any roadblocks.

## Wrap up

Let's see our code in action:

```javascript
node create_account.js
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you're getting an error that "`Sorry, account 'xyz.testnet' is already exists`" then to resolve it change`"near-api-js": "^0.35.0",` in the `package.json` and run `npm install`
{% endhint %}

You should see a similar output if your account is successfully created:

```javascript
Generating a new key pair
Account figment-learn.testnet for network "testnet" was created.
----------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN LINK BELOW to see account in NEAR Explorer!
https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/figment-learn.testnet
----------------------------------------------------------------
```

Our account is created and ready for action!

## Tools

Before we wrap up with this tutorial we would like you to check out [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/), a simple UI to easily and securely manage your account and access keys, transfer or request funds in addition to stake NEAR with network validators. Creation of a new account using Wallet has been covered extensively in the [official documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/local-setup/create-account).

Additionally, you can interact with NEAR blockchain resources via CLI, a command line interface that utilizes the very same `near-api-js` package under the hood. Check out the [official CLI documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli) for usage and examples. Creating additional accounts with CLI is super easy after you have created your initial account using Wallet and connected it to the CLI by running `near login`.

When using CLI with DataHub you will need to specify the RPC endpoint for each command, which might be similar to:

```text
near <command> \
  --nodeUrl=https://near-testnet--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Conclusion

You now have an account on the NEAR Testnet and your access keys are stored in the `credentials/testnet/ACCOUNT.json` file. Your account is also loaded with Testnet tokens that you use for testing purposes. You have also learned how to connect CLI with the DataHub node.

The complete code for this tutorial can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/figment-networks/tutorials/blob/main/near/2_create_account/main.js).

### Next steps

In the next tutorial, we will be looking at different queries we can run against a NEAR node to get the following information:

* Blocks
* Validator set
* Account details
* Gas price
