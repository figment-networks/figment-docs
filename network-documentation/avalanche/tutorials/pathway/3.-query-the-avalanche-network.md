# 3. Query the Avalanche network

## Introduction

We've covered the account creation in the previous tutorial, and now is a good time to dig in and figure out what else we can learn about the Avalanche network. We will cover pulling information from X/P chains using a Javascript client, as well as using Curl to send network calls directly to DataHub.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure to have completed the previous steps of the Pathway:

* [Connecting to Avalanche node with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/avalanche/tutorials/pathway/1.-connect-to-avalanche-node-with-datahub)
* [Creating your first Avalanche account](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/avalanche/tutorials/pathway/2.-create-your-first-avalanche-account)

Tools required:

* [Curl](https://curl.se/) - Most systems come with curl pre-installed. See [Downloads](https://curl.se/download.html) for your OS if you don't have it installed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the Downloads page for your OS. Keep in mind the curl Downloads page is sorted alphabetically, so you'll need to scroll to the bottom for Windows!

## Querying the network

We've briefly covered fetching data from network in the second tutorial, after we have successfully funded the address with Faucet. Retrieving address balances is one of the common tasks you'll be doing while working with the Avalanche, however, there's simply more functionality available to us to play with.

Our areas of interest includes both P and X chains, they offer different information and require separate clients. So far we have only worked with X-Chain.

Let's go ahead and prepare a new file, called `query.js`:

```javascript
// Load Avalanche client helper
const client = require("./client")

async function main() {
  console.log("========== Info ==========")
  await queryInfo(client.Info())

  console.log("========== Platform Chain Info ==========")
  await queryPChain(client.PChain())

  console.log("========== Exchange Chain Info ==========")
  await queryXChain(client.XChain())
}

async function queryInfo(info) {
  // 1.Query info
}

async function queryPChain(pChain) {
  // 2. Query P-Chain
}

async function queryXChain(xChain) {
  // 3. Query X-Chain
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.log("We have encountered an error!")
  console.error(err)
})
```

Again, same template, but we've just created a placeholder method for querying information using different clients.

Avalanche provides a set of clients, mapping them directly to the [JSONRPC endpoints](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis), so once you get familiar with method signatures, you'll be able to make HTTP calls with `curl` in no time.

### Query info

Avalanche Info API provides basic information about the network, such as software version that the node is running, its bootstrapping status, TX fees, etc. All code in this section should be added into the `queryInfo` function.

Each chain in Avalanche has an internal ID, with addition of aliases used by the primary chains, like X/P/C chains. We could obtain the actual IDs via a few API calls. Also, when working with a network node \(being that private node or a public one, like DataHub's\) it's important to know if a certain chain \(P/X\) is bootstrapped before sending any valuable transactions.

Add the following code into the `queryInfo` method:

```javascript
console.log("- X:", await info.getBlockchainID("X"), await info.isBootstrapped("X"))
console.log("- P:", await info.getBlockchainID("P"), await info.isBootstrapped("P"))
console.log("- C:", await info.getBlockchainID("C"), await info.isBootstrapped("C"))
console.log("- Fees:", await info.getTxFee())
```

We're getting the blockchain IDs and their bootstrapped status for primary chains + current fees for certain operations.

[More details about Info API](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/info-api)

### Query P-Chain

P-Chain holds information about staking and validators on the network. How such information is useful, you might ask?

With a just few client method calls you can obtain a list of validating participants, their total stake, how many delegations they hold, duration of such delegations, potential staking rewards, or any information that you might need if you plan to get involved with staking activities. Popular block explorers also utilize the raw network information and wrap that in a nice UI.

Onto the code, add the following snippet into the `queryPChain` method:

```javascript
// Fetch validator subnets
console.log("Fetching validator subnets...")
const subnets = await pChain.getSubnets()
console.log("Found subnets:", subnets.length)
console.log("Subnet example:", subnets[0])

// Fetch information about Platform chain
console.log("Fetching validators...")
const { validators } = await pChain.getCurrentValidators()
console.log("Found validators:", validators.length)
console.log("Example validator:", validators[0])
```

We're fetching subnets and validators. Subnet represents a group of validators that form consensus on a state of a blockchain. Primary P-Chain will have a greater number of active validators \(800+ as of March 2021\). We're also retrieving the full list of active validators on the network.

Next, we can inspect validator's reward address \(keep adding to the existing method\):

```javascript
// Fetch validator details
const validator = validators[0]
const ownerBalance = await pChain.getBalance(validator.rewardOwner.addresses[0])
console.log("Validator owner balance:", ownerBalance.balance)
```

Can also query generic P-Chain info like block height, minimum amount for staking activities, and total supply:

```javascript
// Fetch current height
const height = await pChain.getHeight()
console.log("Current height:", height.toString(10))

// Fetch current minimum staking amount for running a validator
const minStake = await pChain.getMinStake()
console.log("Current min stake:", minStake.minValidatorStake.toString(10))

// Fetch current supply
const supply = await pChain.getCurrentSupply()
console.log("Current supply:", supply.toString(10))
```

[More details about P-Chain API](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/platform-chain-p-chain-api)

### Query X-Chain

X-Chain is used for any asset exchange operations: simple transactions, interchain token transfers, asset minting and so on. We're going to expand on this topic in the following tutorials.

For now, let's just add a few lines of code into the `queryXChain` method:

```javascript
const fee = await xChain.getDefaultTxFee()
console.log("Default Fee:", fee.toString(10))
```

We're fetching the default TX fee on the X-Chain. It'll get handy when it's time to create a transaction, as transaction processing on the network is not free and you'll need to calculate the full transaction amount including the fee.

Next, we want to check on transaction status to see if it's accepted or rejected:

```javascript
const status = await xChain.getTxStatus("2AjbGiRg1KG7FtuJqVEtCzi48n8jpwWdLLYwnBxfFCwMozMLMg")
console.log("Transaction status:", status)
```

Get all asset balances of an address:

```javascript
const balances = await xChain.getAllBalances("X-fuji1h4646056wc84fr7jlmmx7t6u3e348ehwzefl5u")
console.log("Balances:", balances)
```

[More information on X-Chain API](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/exchange-chain-x-chain-api)

### Running the code

With all pieces of the puzzle in place, we can finally see our creation in action! Run the code with:

```javascript
node query.js
```

Successful output might look similar to:

```javascript

Looking pretty good so far! That concludes our experiments with the client methods of Avalanche.js library. Next, we'll try our hand at making HTTP API calls with `curl`.

## Query from terminal

While using the javascript client is convenient, not all environments will provide Node.js,, or even allow installation of third-party packages. Or we just want to make a quick call to check the transaction status, or find out if a validator is active on the network. You know, for miscellaneous purposes. That's when tools like `curl` or `httpie` are quite useful.

First, we want to make sure `curl` can interact with the DataHub API we configured in the first tutorial. We can set the API endpoint with:

```javascript
export DATAHUB_API_URL=https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/YOUR_API_KEY
```

Next, make a `curl` call from our terminal to check the status of this example transaction:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id"     :1,
  "method" :"avm.getTxStatus",
  "params" :{
    "txID":"2AjbGiRg1KG7FtuJqVEtCzi48n8jpwWdLLYwnBxfFCwMozMLMg"
  }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' $DATAHUB_API_URL/ext/bc/X
```

Avalanche API endpoints are using [JSONRPC protocol](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) over HTTP. Each chain will have a different URL prefix, like `/ext/bc/X` or `/ext/P`, for X-Chain and P-Chain respectively. Request `method` is also prefixed by the component, like `avm` or `evm`. Some methods take parameters, some don't. You should check[ API documentation](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/issuing-api-calls) to see the exact list of parameters for each method.

If you got the `DATAHUB_API_URL` set right, you'll see the output:

```javascript
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"status":"Accepted"},"id":1}
```

Response includes useful information in the `result` field. We can see that our transaction is `Accepted`, same as when we used javascript to fetch the status.

{% hint style="info" %}
DataHub provides multiple options for API authentication: In the example above we're using API key as part of the request path, however, most of the examples in the pathway are actually using header-based authentication. Visit [Avalanche service page](https://datahub.figment.io/services/avalanche/avalanche--fuji--rpc) to see how to use both authentication methods.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

Getting the hang of it? Nice! We've learned a lot in this tutorial: what information is available in different API endpoints, how configure clients for different chains, and finally, how to query network with curl. All this experience won't go unused.

Also, depending on your proficiency with programming in general, you might have learned how to structure your code a bit, keep methods short, split code into files when necessary.

## Next Steps

Being able to query Avalanche network is fun, but wouldn't it be great if you could not only read but also write to the blockchain? In the next tutorial, we will explore the use of transactions in order to write to the blockchain state.
