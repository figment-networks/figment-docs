# ðŸŽ® RPC & REST API

## Time to play

Celo uses ContractKit, a library to help developers and validators to interact with the Celo blockchain and is well suited to developers looking for an easy way to integrate Celo Smart Contracts within their applications. Although the[ **Web3 library**](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) was intended to be used only with Ethereum, due to the nature of Celo, we can still use the majority of its features. The ContractKit, for every interaction with the node, uses a Web3 instance.
