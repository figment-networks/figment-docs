# ðŸŽŠ Enriched APIs

## Overview

The common network APIs should only be the beginning of the journey for Web 3 developers. Figment is developing Enriched APIs to help developers unlock the unique features and attributes of Web 3 protocols. Our suite of Enriched APIs allows developers to create powerful applications at a fraction of the cost, with the potential to capitalize on blockchain-native use cases.

Enriched APIs complement the common APIs to give its users superpowers in order to create the Web 3's killer apps.

Try them out today with [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign\_up?service=terra)!

Check out the list of available Enriched APIs on Terra below.

## Transaction Search

The first Enriched API available on Terra DataHub is the Transaction Search API. It allows users to filter and query by account, transaction type, and date range. Users can also search by memo field and logs. Developers can now manipulate transaction data the way they want to instead of the way the blockchain intended them to. Transaction Search cuts significant indexing and development time as well as maintenance resources.

The Transaction Search API documentation for Terra can be found below.
